# How Many of All Bugs Do We Find? A Study of Static Bug Detectors

## ABSTRACT

Static bug detectors are becoming increasingly popular and are widely used by professional software developers. While most work on bug detectors focuses on whether they find bugs at all, and on how many false positives they report in addition to legitimate warnings, the inverse question is often neglected: How many of all real-world bugs do static bug detectors find? This paper addresses this question by studying the results of applying three widely used static bug detectors to an extended version of the Defects4J dataset that consists of 15 Java projects with 594 known bugs. To decide which of these bugs the tools detect, we use a novel methodology that combines an automatic analysis of warnings and bugs with a manual validation of each candidate of a detected bug. The results of the study show that: (i) static bug detectors find a non-negligible amount of all bugs, (ii) different tools are mostly complementary to each other, and (iii) current bug detectors miss the large majority of the studied bugs. A detailed analysis of bugs missed by the static detectors shows that some bugs could have been found by variants of the existing detectors, while others are domain-specific problems that do not match any existing bug pattern. These findings help potential users of such tools to assess their utility, motivate and outline directions for future work on static bug detection, and provide a basis for future comparisons of static bug detection with other bug finding techniques, such as manual and automated testing.

静态bug检测器正变得越来越流行，并被专业软件开发人员广泛使用。虽然大多数bug检测器的工作都集中在它们是否找到了bug，以及除了合法的警告之外，它们还报告了多少错误，但是相反的问题常常被忽略:所有真实的bug中有多少是静态bug检测器发现的?本文通过研究将三种广泛使用的静态bug检测器应用到扩展版的缺陷4j数据集的结果来解决这个问题，该数据集由15个Java项目组成，其中有594个已知bug。为了确定工具检测到哪些bug，我们使用了一种新方法，该方法将对警告和bug的自动分析与对检测到的每个候选bug的手动验证相结合。研究结果表明:(1)静态的bug检测器发现的bug数量是不可忽视的;(2)不同的工具大多是互补的;(3)当前的bug检测器遗漏了大部分被研究的bug。对静态检测器遗漏的bug的详细分析表明，有些bug可能是由现有检测器的变体发现的，而其他的则是与现有bug模式不匹配的特定于域的问题。这些发现有助于这些工具的潜在用户评估它们的效用、激励和概述未来静态bug检测工作的方向，并为将来静态bug检测与其他bug发现技术(如手动和自动测试)的比较提供基础。
