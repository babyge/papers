# Programming in Standard ML

# Part I Overview

StandardMLis a type-safe programming language that embodies many innovative ideas in programming language design. It is a statically typed language, with an extensible type system. It supports polymorphic type inference, which all but eliminates the burden of specifying types of variables and greatly facilitates code re-use. It provides efficient automatic storage management for data structures and functions. It encourages functional (effect-free) programming where appropriate, but allows imperative (effect-ful) programming where necessary. It facilitates programming with recursive and symbolic data structures by supporting the definition of functions by pattern matching. It features an extensible exception mechanism for handling error conditions and effecting non-local transfers of control. It provides a richly expressive and flexible module system for structuring large programs, including mechanisms for enforcing abstraction, imposing hierarchical structure, and building generic modules. It is portable across platforms and implementations because it has a precise definition. It provides a portable standard basis library that defines a rich collection of commonly-used types and routines.

StandardML是一种类型安全的编程语言，它在编程语言设计中体现了许多创新的思想。它是一种静态类型语言，具有可扩展的类型系统。它支持多态类型推断，这几乎消除了指定变量类型的负担，并极大地促进了代码的重用。它为数据结构和功能提供了高效的自动存储管理。它在适当的时候鼓励函数式(无效果)编程，但在必要的时候允许命令式(有效)编程。它通过模式匹配支持函数定义，从而简化了使用递归和符号数据结构的编程。它提供了一个可扩展的异常机制来处理错误条件和影响控制的非本地转移。它为构造大型程序提供了具有丰富表达能力和灵活性的模块系统，包括执行抽象、实施分层结构和构建通用模块的机制。它是跨平台和实现的可移植的，因为它有一个精确的定义。它提供了一个可移植的标准基础库，定义了丰富的常用类型和例程集合。

Many implementations go beyond the standard to provide experimental language features, extensive libraries of commonly-used routines, and useful program development tools. Details can be found with the documentation for your compiler, but here’s some of what you may expect. Most implementations provide an interactive system supporting on-line program development, including tools for compiling, linking, and analyzing the behavior of programs. A few implementations are “batch compilers” that rely on the ambient operating system to manage the construction of large programs from compiled parts. Nearly every compiler generates native machine code, even when used interactively, but some also generate code for a portable abstract machine. Most implementations support separate compilation and provide tools for managing large systems and shared libraries. Some implementations provide tools for tracing and stepping programs; many provide tools for time and space profiling. Most implementations supplement the standard basis library with a rich collection of handy components such as dictionaries, hash tables, or interfaces to the ambient operating system. Some implementations support language extensions such as support for concurrent programming (using messagepassing or locking), richer forms of modularity constructs, and support for “lazy” data structures.
