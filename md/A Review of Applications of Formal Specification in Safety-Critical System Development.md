# A Review of Applications of Formal Specification in Safety-Critical System Development

## ABSTRACT

Since the advent of the computer and computer programming there have been many attempts to improve the quality of the software systems developed. At various stages in this evolution of development techniques, processes, and methodologies, a review of the current trend in software development is conducted. One such current trend is in the realm of safety-critical system development. Safety-critical systems are characterized by the resulting potential of harm to or loss of life if such systems should fail during operation. A strategy applied in developing such systems is the use of formal specification techniques. Formal specification techniques are the application of rigorous techniques to assess the correctness of system design. The use of formal specification techniques in safety-critical system development has been in place for a number of decades and there have been multiple reviews and comparisons of the successful and failed application of formal specification techniques. This report reviews examples of the application of formal specification techniques in a number of application domains, with a focus on the types of error detection and correction associated with the particular technique. The benefit of this work is towards the assessment of the suitable of a specific formal specification technique with a particular problem domain.

自从计算机和计算机程序设计出现以来，已经有了许多提高所开发的软件系统质量的尝试。在开发技术、过程和方法发展的不同阶段，对软件开发的当前趋势进行了回顾。当前的一个趋势是在安全关键系统开发领域。对安全至关重要的系统的特征是，如果这些系统在运行过程中发生故障，可能会造成伤害或生命损失。在开发这样的系统时采用的策略是使用正式的规范技术。正式规范技术是严格技术的应用，以评估系统设计的正确性。在安全关键系统开发中使用正式规范技术已经有几十年的历史了，对正式规范技术的成功应用和失败应用进行了多次审查和比较。本报告回顾了形式规范技术在许多应用领域中的应用实例，重点介绍了与特定技术相关的错误检测和纠正的类型。这项工作的好处是有助于评估具有特定问题领域的特定形式规范技术的适用性。
