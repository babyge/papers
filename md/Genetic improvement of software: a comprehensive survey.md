# Genetic improvement of software: a comprehensive survey

## Abstract

Genetic improvement (GI) uses automated search to find improved versions of existing software. We present a comprehensive survey of this nascent field of research with a focus on the core papers in the area published between 1995 and 2015. We identified core publications including empirical studies, 96% of which use evolutionary algorithms (genetic programming in particular). Although we can trace the foundations of GI back to the origins of computer science itself, our analysis reveals a significant upsurge in activity since 2012. GI has resulted in dramatic performance improvements for a diverse set of properties such as execution time, energy and memory consumption, as well as results for fixing and extending existing system functionality. Moreover, we present examples of research work that lies on the boundary between GI and other areas, such as program transformation, approximate computing, and software repair, with the intention of encouraging further exchange of ideas between researchers in these fields.

遗传改进 (GI) 使用自动搜索来查找现有软件的改进版本。我们对这一新生研究领域进行了全面调查，重点是 1995年和 2015 发表的该领域的核心论文。我们确定了核心出版物，包括实证研究，其中 96% 使用进化算法 (特别是遗传编程)。尽管我们可以追溯 GI 的基础到计算机科学本身的起源，但我们的分析揭示了 2012年活动的显著高潮。GI 为执行时间、能量和内存消耗等多种属性带来了显著的性能改进，并为修复和扩展现有系统功能带来了结果。此外，我们还展示了位于 GI 和其他领域边界的研究工作的例子，例如程序转换、近似计算和软件修复,目的是鼓励这些领域的研究人员之间进一步交流想法。
