# A Survey on Network Verification and Testing With Formal Methods: Approaches and Challenges

## Abstract

Networks have grown increasingly complicated. Violations of intended policies can compromise network availability and network reliability. Network operators need to ensure that their policies are correctly implemented. This has inspired a research field, network verification and testing, that enables users to automatically detect bugs and systematically reason their network. Furthermore, techniques ranging from formal modeling to verification and testing have been applied to help operators build reliable systems in electronic design automation and software. Inspired by its success, network verification has recently seen increased attention in the academic and industrial communities. As an area of current interest, it is an interdisciplinary subject (with fields including formal methods, mathematical logic, programming languages, and networks), making it daunting for a nonprofessional. We perform a comprehensive survey on well-developed methodologies and tools for data plane verification, control plane verification, data plane testing and control plane testing. This survey also provides lessons gained from existing solutions and a perspective of future research developments.

网络变得越来越复杂。违反预期的策略可能危及网络可用性和网络可靠性。网络运营商需要确保他们的策略得到正确执行。这激发了一个研究领域，网络验证和测试，使用户能够自动检测错误和系统地推理他们的网络。此外，从正式建模到验证和测试的技术已经被应用于帮助操作员在电子设计自动化和软件中建立可靠的系统。受其成功的鼓舞，网络验证最近在学术界和工业界受到了越来越多的关注。作为当前感兴趣的一个领域，它是一门跨学科的学科(其领域包括形式方法、数学逻辑、编程语言和网络)，这让非专业人士望而生畏。我们对数据平面验证、控制平面验证、数据平面测试和控制平面测试的方法和工具进行了全面的调查。本调查还提供了从现有解决方案中获得的教训和对未来研究发展的展望。
