# A Survey of Static Formal Methods for Building Dependable Industrial Automation Systems

## Abstract

Industrial automation systems (IAS) need to be highly dependable; they should not merely function as expected but also do so in a reliable, safe, and secure manner. Formal methods are mathematical techniques that can greatly aid in developing dependable systems and can be used across all phases of the system development life cycle (SDLC), including requirements engineering, system design and implementation, verification and validation (testing), maintenance, and even documentation. This state-of-theart survey reports existing formal approaches for creating more dependable IAS, focusing on static formal methods that are used before a system is completely implemented. We categorize surveyed works based on the phases of the SDLC, allowing us to identify research gaps and promising future directions for each phase.

工业自动化系统(IAS)需要高度可靠;它们不应仅仅按预期发挥作用，还应以可靠、安全和可靠的方式发挥作用。形式化方法是一种数学技术，它可以极大地帮助开发可靠的系统，并且可以跨系统开发生命周期(SDLC)的所有阶段使用，包括需求工程、系统设计和实现、验证和验证(测试)、维护，甚至文档。这项最新的调查报告了创建更可靠的IAS的现有正式方法，重点介绍了在系统完全实现之前使用的静态正式方法。我们根据SDLC的阶段对调查的作品进行分类，这使我们能够确定研究的空白和每个阶段的未来发展方向。
